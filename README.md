# Thoth

Thoth is a GUI program helping for labeling dataset. The program will automatically add  column `class_label`, so you
have to make sure that the name does not crash. This program still has many possible improvements. Feel free to fork and
PR. Please note that the output file as `.csv` of the data set would be available in the same folder of the source code.

## Installation

Make sure you have `Python` installed in your system along side with `pip`.

Then simply use `pip` to install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next is to create file called `labels.txt`. In this file, it contains the label by having each label separated by new line.


## Usage

To start the program, simply run `main.py`.
